A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means the last element inserted into the stack is the first element to be removed. A stack is like a stack of plates, where new plates are added to the top, and plates can only be removed from the top.

A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. Here are some operations:

Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.

Pop: This operation removes the top element from the stack.

Top: This operation returns the size of the stack.

Peek: This operation returns the top element without removing it.

isEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty or not.

isFull: This operation checks if the stack is full or not.

The time complexity of stack operations is O(1) regardless of the implementation method used.
