A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference (or a pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

The first node in the sequence is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. The tail node's reference to the next node is usually null or a sentinel value to indicate the end of the list.

The singly linked list allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at the beginning of the list by simply updating the reference of the head node. However, insertion and deletion operations at the end of the list or in the middle of the list require traversing the list to find the correct position, which can be less efficient.

Singly linked lists are often used to implement other data structures, such as stacks and queues, and as a building block for more complex data structures like graphs and trees.
