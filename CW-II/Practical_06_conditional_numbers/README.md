In Python, the `min()` and `max()` functions are built-in functions that can be used to find the smallest and largest values in a sequence of numbers or other iterable objects.

The `min()` function takes one or more arguments and returns the smallest of those values. For example:

```python
>>> min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
1
>>> min([5, 3, 9, 1, 7])
1
```

In the first example, the `min()` function takes five arguments and returns the smallest one, which is 1. In the second example, the `min()` function takes a list of numbers and returns the smallest one, which is also 1.

The `max()` function works similarly, but returns the largest value in a sequence of numbers or other iterable objects. For example:

```python
>>> max(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
5
>>> max([5, 3, 9, 1, 7])
9
```

In the first example, the `max()` function takes five arguments and returns the largest one, which is 5. In the second example, the `max()` function takes a list of numbers and returns the largest one, which is 9.

Both `min()` and `max()` functions also work on non-numeric objects like strings or tuples, where the order of the elements is determined by their position in the ASCII table.
