In Python, the `datetime` module provides classes for working with dates and times. Here are some explanations for commonly used functions and classes within the `datetime` module:

1. `datetime`: This is a class in the `datetime` module that represents a date and time. It has several attributes such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
2. `datetime.date.today()`: This is a method that returns the current local date as a `datetime.date` object. The `datetime.date` class represents only the date, without any time information.
3. `datetime.timedelta`: This is a class that represents a duration, or the difference between two dates or times. It has several attributes such as days, seconds, and microseconds.
4. `datetime.date.strftime()`: This is a method that formats a `datetime.date` object as a string. It takes a format string as an argument and returns a string representing the date according to the format specified.
